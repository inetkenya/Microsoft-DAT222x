In 2016, SurveyMonkey and NBC administered web surveys to determine the preferences of voters in each state.
Suppose 10,000 voters responded in each state.
Would the preferences obtained from the survey reflect the preferences of all voters in the state? 
If not, what type of bias has occurred?
Answer : Response bias

What is the simplest way to overcome this problem and get an accurate estimate of the voter preferences in each state?
Answer : Survey a simple random sample of 1500 voters in each state.
